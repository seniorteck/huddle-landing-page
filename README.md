### What I learned

for styling svg icon i used for the social media brand icon i learnt how to use the 

css{
filter: invert() #to invert the color to white, but i can use it for any other color except cyling through dark(black) and light(white) }

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```
so at the end of the day i discard it because i could not figure out how ot use it for the :hover section. 
so i revert back to the font-Awesome web icons with <i class></i> because this allows me to easy change the color of the icons easily with CSS color property

```
